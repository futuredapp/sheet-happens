# Sheet Happens! ðŸ¦„

Sheet Happens is Gradle plugin that lets you localize your Android / KMP application using Google Spreadsheets.

## Features

- Supports strings and plurals
- Compatible with Android and Kotlin Multiplatform ([moko-resources](https://github.com/icerockdev/moko-resources))
  resources format
- Flexible configuration options
- Can be applied to multiple modules separately (useful for splitting translations per feature module)

## Installation

Make sure you have Gradle Plugin Portal in your repositories:

```kotlin
pluginManagement {
    repositories {
        gradlePluginPortal()
    }
}
```

Then add the plugin to your module-level `build.gradle` or `build.gradle.kts` file:

```kotlin
plugins {
    id("app.futured.sheethappens") version "$latestVersion"
}
```

## Usage

### Get ready your Google Spreadsheet

1. Get yourself an API key to [Google Sheets API](https://developers.google.com/sheets/api/guides/concepts).
2. Create a Google Sheet and add your translations in it:

Note the following:

- You can find the Spreadsheet ID in the URL and Sheet name at the bottom of the page. You will use them to configure
  connection to the Sheets API
- The __first row__ always contains names of columns. You will use these names to configure the plugin so it know where
  to look for specific information in your Sheet
- The Section column is optional and can be used for inserting comments in XML resource files generated by the plugin
- There always has to be a key column to identify translations and at least one column with translated strings

### Plugin Configuration

Use the `sheetHappens` configuration block to configure the plugin, these are all available options:

```kotlin
sheetHappens {
    spreadsheetId.set("Spreadsheet ID, eg. bKGtVRjP-m_HNsiZJNE5qWH3FweSNlRQv4tsM1WkF65J7ZgqB_WWqN")
    sheetName.set("Sheet name, eg. Sheet1")
    apiKey.set("API Key ****")

    sheetLayout {
        sectionColumnName.set("section") // Optional
        keyColumnName.set("key")

        // Add language column for each translation
        languageColumn("EN" to "values")
        languageColumn("SK" to "values-sk")
    }

    resourcesLayout {
        resourcesDir.set(layout.projectDirectory.dir("src/main/res"))

        splitResources = false // Optional, default `false`
        stringsFileName = "strings.xml" // Optional, default "strings.xml" 
        pluralsFileName = "plurals.xml" // Optional, default "plurals.xml"
    }
}
```

The `sheetLayout` object tells the plugin where to look for section names, string keys and each of translations.
The `languageColumn()` function takes a pair of Strings, where former is the translation column name in Google Sheet and
latter is resource folder where strings for this translation will be generated.

The `resourcesLayout` object tell the plugin how to structure generated strings in your project.
Strings are generated in the `strings.xml` file by default. You can specify name of this file using `stringsFileName`
Property.   
If you wish to generate plurals in separate file, you can set `splitResources = true` and plurals will be placed in the
second file named by `pluralsFileName` property.

### Usage

The plugin will register a Gradle task called `makeSheetHappen` ðŸŒˆ which will read your Google Sheet and generate string
resources for each language column you specified.

This Gradle plugin was inspired by
Ackee's [Spreadsheet Localizer INTELLIJ IDEA plugin](https://github.com/AckeeCZ/Spreadsheet-Localizer-Plugin) & it is
fully compatible with their Google Sheet formatting.
